            <p>As a possible wireframe, the wireframe shown is the original wireframe idea that will be used for each
                page.

            <p>The second possible wireframe is shown to be more traditional where the navigation bar sits at the top of
                the
                page and the content of the page is in the middle. I would consider this wireframe to not be so
                minimalistic
                since the content of the feels that it takes up a lot of the space on the page. However, this could be
                the
                image
                blocks that I placed next to the main text block.

            <p>
                The two homepage high fidelity wireframes show the colours that I plan to use for each component. I
                chose contrasting colours for my navigation menu button when the button is on the page and then when the
                button is hovered on. I decided to use a dotted border for the button to lead the user towards hovering
                over the button. The button will be filled in when hovered over to indicate to the user that something
                is happening to button.
                The navigation list will appear when the button is clicked and will disappear when the button is clicked
                again. The current page will be indicated by the filled border of the current page.
            </p>

            <p>
                My index pages will make use of the same styling for the navigation button and row as the homepage. The
                only difference will be shown on the index pages where there are sub-pages avaliable to view from the
                index pages. The background semi-circle for the index pages will be shifted to the left side of the
                screen. This will be for the set-up of the navigation scrolling between the sub-page sections. I plan to
                include an excerpt from the most recent item of the sub-page in the middle of the screen. There will be
                a contrasting border around the excerpt and the link to the full item will have the same dotted line
                border as the menu button to indicate to the user it will be linking to another page.
            </p>

        <section class="e-content">
            <h2>Reference Material</h2>
            <p>
                The positioning of my content in the middle of each page is taken from three refernce websites:
                <a class="Reference" href="https://www.hivetown.co/" target="_blank">Hivetown</a>, <a class="Reference"
                    href="https://www.arena.net/en" target="_blank">ArenaNet</a>, and <a class="Reference"
                    href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/home" target="_blank">Honkai:
                    Star Rail</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the Hivetown website, I like the placing of the content in the middle of the page which allows me to
                read
                highlited text blocks while also being able to view transitions that may appear on the sides of the
                screen
                as well as keeping my eyes more relaxed. I don't need to read long lines of text across the whole page,
                instead I can focus on the short text blocks without straining my eyes from reading too far left or too
                far
                right.

                One design choice that I find a bit distracting is the navigation button that appears after scrolling
                down
                from the top of each page. At the top of each page there is a horizontal navigation bar to different
                pages
                on the website and when that is no longer visible I do like the appearance of the navigation list icon.
                However, when I click on the navigation icon, a transistion takes place which covers the entire screen.
                The
                same transistion takes place when the icon is clicked again. I find that the transistion become a bit
                distracting from the content of the page since it covers the whole page and blocks the view of the
                content.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ArenaNet website makes use of the content placed in the middle of the page as well. This again helps
                me
                focus on the content of the page without straining to read across the entire page. I enjoy that the
                images
                use a transition as a splash of paint or colour to indicate that that item on the page has been viewed.
                There is also a sort of progress bar on the left side of the homepage which indicated to me that I am at
                a
                certain point in the list of items displayed.

                I also enjoy the use of this transistion across each page. It makes me feel as a user that I am making
                each
                page come to life when I visit the page.

                There is also the use of transition to the top of each page however it is not exaclty intuitive. Instead
                of
                an arrow pointing upwards, I can click on the page's title to scroll back to the top of the page. It is
                an
                interesting way that was used instead of the standard up pointing arrow.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the Honaki: Star Rail website I like the center content, aligned images and navigation. This leads me
                to
                focus on each section of text or image that is being displayed.

                One thing that I do find a bit difficult to read is the bar on the right hand side of the homepage. It
                shows
                the icons for the social media platforms that I can click on to view the account pages for the game.
                However, the text has been placed vertically where I would need to tilt my head to read the text. The
                designers probably wanted to make sure the user knows that the links will lead to the offical accounts
                for
                the game but it does feel out of place to have the text in a different direction to the text everywhere
                else
                on the page.

            <h2>General Composition</h2>
            <p>
                Fonts play an important role in readability of each page, so I want to continue looking into fonts
                and
                how well each would work on my website. I have not yet at this stage narrowed down to any font.
            </p>

            <p>
                I want to look more into colour theory and relationships. I have two colours in mind to be my
                primary
                colours of my website, however I am struggling to decide on secondary colours which will complement
                my
                two chosen colours.
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of the composition of my style, I want a center aligned area to showcase what each page
                displays. However, for the alignment of the actual text I want a left alignment to keep the standard
                reading alignment that most users read in.
            </p>

            <p>
                For my visual representations of my interface elements, I want to guide my user to reach titles
                first by
                having a larger font size and then moving to the description of the page item, and lastly to the
                navigation section of each page. The navigation will be visually represented by buttons and icons.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the positioning and shape of my UI, I want the UI to be visible to my user. This will be done by
                using contrasting colours to my chosen background colour, and using inviting shape styles such as
                rounded corners of buttons and rounded shapes indicating the current page in the navigation bar.

            </p>
            <p>
                Rounded fonts like Coiny and Chicle could be two options I use, but with Chicle the capital ’f’ and
                lower ‘f’ look very similar. For consistency I have to check the different version of letters such as
                ‘a’ which can look different in various fonts.
            </p>
            <p>
                A font like Nova Square gives me an impression of sci-fi or space related text. Since my aesthetic is
                surrounding the world, or my world, this could be another option.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m not too sure whether I want the chosen font to be the title fonts only and use a standard font for
                the other blocks of text like the blog posts, essays, or other large sections of text to ensure
                readability of my pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                To ensure responsive design and typography I plan to use the relative unit rem for my text to remain
                legible and readable on both desktop and mobile devices.
