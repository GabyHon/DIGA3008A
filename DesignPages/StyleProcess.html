            <img src="../Images/Possible design 1.jpg" alt="Option wireframe 1." width="300" height="200">
            As a possible wireframe, the wireframe shown is the original wireframe idea that will be used for each page.
        </p>

            <img src="../Images/Possible design 2.jpg" alt="Option wireframe 2." width="300" height="200">
            The second possible wireframe is shown to be more traditional where the navigation bar sits at the top of
            the
            page and the content of the page is in the middle. I would consider this wireframe to not be so minimalistic
            since the content of the feels that it takes up a lot of the space on the page. However, this could be the
            image
            blocks that I placed next to the main text block.

    <section class="e-content">
        <h1>Reference Material</h1>
        <p>
            The positioning of my content in the middle of each page is taken from three refernce websites:
            <a href="https://www.hivetown.co/" target="_blank">Hivetown</a>, <a href="https://www.arena.net/en"
                target="_blank">ArenaNet</a>, and <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/home" target="_blank">Honkai:
                Star Rail</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the Hivetown website, I like the placing of the content in the middle of the page which allows me to read
            highlited text blocks while also being able to view transitions that may appear on the sides of the screen
            as well as keeping my eyes more relaxed. I don't need to read long lines of text across the whole page,
            instead I can focus on the short text blocks without straining my eyes from reading too far left or too far
            right.

            One design choice that I find a bit distracting is the navigation button that appears after scrolling down
            from the top of each page. At the top of each page there is a horizontal navigation bar to different pages
            on the website and when that is no longer visible I do like the appearance of the navigation list icon.
            However, when I click on the navigation icon, a transistion takes place which covers the entire screen. The
            same transistion takes place when the icon is clicked again. I find that the transistion become a bit
            distracting from the content of the page since it covers the whole page and blocks the view of the content.
        </p>

        <p>
            The ArenaNet website makes use of the content placed in the middle of the page as well. This again helps me
            focus on the content of the page without straining to read across the entire page. I enjoy that the images
            use a transition as a splash of paint or colour to indicate that that item on the page has been viewed.
            There is also a sort of progress bar on the left side of the homepage which indicated to me that I am at a
            certain point in the list of items displayed.

            I also enjoy the use of this transistion across each page. It makes me feel as a user that I am making each
            page come to life when I visit the page.

            There is also the use of transition to the top of each page however it is not exaclty intuitive. Instead of
            an arrow pointing upwards, I can click on the page's title to scroll back to the top of the page. It is an
            interesting way that was used instead of the standard up pointing arrow.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the Honaki: Star Rail website I like the center content, aligned images and navigation. This leads me to
            focus on each section of text or image that is being displayed.

            One thing that I do find a bit difficult to read is the bar on the right hand side of the homepage. It shows
            the icons for the social media platforms that I can click on to view the account pages for the game.
            However, the text has been placed vertically where I would need to tilt my head to read the text. The
            designers probably wanted to make sure the user knows that the links will lead to the offical accounts for
            the game but it does feel out of place to have the text in a different direction to the text everywhere else
            on the page.
