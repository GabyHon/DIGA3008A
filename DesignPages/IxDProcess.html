        <h2 class="p-name">Overall Goal for my Website</h2>
        <p class="e-content">
            The overall goal that I have for my website is to create a minimalistic style while showcasing a few
            advanced
            technical skills on the website. I want to keep each page of my website minimal where a few select
            images and text blocks are
            shown at a time. This will encourage potential job recruiters as well as general users to gain more
            insight
            into who I am by focusing on one item at a time.
