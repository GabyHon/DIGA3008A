            <h2>Can we build an ethical internet?</h2>
            <p>
                An ethical internet, for me, looks like a place where users can engage in a digital space while being
                protected from manipulation and exploitation. Data privacy can often be compromised by corporations and
                weak regulations. This raises concerns about how users have control over their personal information and
                data. In what way will a user have access to content without first thinking about how their data may be
                used or exploited?
            </p>
            <p>
                I looked into the three prescribed readings about the online space and the ethics surrounding the online
                space. In the first reading Orgad [1] explores the ideas of Roger Silverstone which emphasise the role
                of media in shaping ethical interactions online. The second reading showed Papacharissi [2] questioning
                whether online spaces truly enable democratic engagement or reinforce existing inequalities. The third
                reading is about Stein [3] examining the status of public spaces on the internet and highlighting legal
                challenges in defining free speech online. These views provide a foundation for understanding how an
                ethical internet must be shaped through policy, technological development, and social responsibility.
                These theoretical perspectives frame the foundation of digital ethics, but the practical implementation
                of an ethical internet is challenged by emerging concerns - particularly in data privacy and the ethics
                of big data.

                I made several changes to my website to better integrate JavaScript functionalities. One of the biggest
                shifts has been implementing dynamic features that improve user interactivity, such as interactive
                points and smoother transitions. JavaScript allows real-time responsiveness which makes the experience
                feel more engaging rather than rigid and static where only HTML and CSS are used. This is shown mainly
                in the navigation bar of my website. Instead of hard coding the selection of the menu button with CSS
                and HTML, this can be done with JavaScript to provide a more dynamic interface for users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking at the challenges of big data privacy sees that unlike traditional data storage, massive
                datasets containing sensitive information pose heightened risks to individuals, businesses, and society.
                Individual&apos;s personal data, such as financial records, health information, and online behaviours,
                can be
                exposed or misused. If privacy protections fail, this could lead to identity theft, surveillance, or
                manipulation which would become an unethical internet. This can also risk businesses and organisations
                which store large datasets. Massive cyberattacks may become more frequent and lead to financial losses,
                reputation damage or legal consequences. Society as a whole would also be at risk where weak privacy
                protections can lead to mass data exploitation and enable unethical practices or misinformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mehmood et al. [4] highlight how privacy-preserving mechanisms must evolve alongside expanding data
                collection practices. The sheer scale of big data poses an increased risk of privacy breaches since
                multiple organizations handle and would process the data [4]. The ethical concerns would come into play
                when corporations or governments collect, store and analyse user&apos;s data without consent. Mehmood et
                al.
                [4] strongly emphasise that there is a need for stronger regulations and responsibilities to ensure
                ethical data handling. There should be a balance between innovation of data-driven achievements with
                privacy protection of individuals, businesses, and society as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                A real-world case example of the consequences of privacy breaches is the cyberattack seen in 2024 and
                data leak of Cell C&apos;s company data [5]. The stolen data was sensitive customer data which included
                full
                names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver&apos;s license numbers, medical records,
                and
                passport details. This case highlights the real-world consequences of poor data security which
                reinforces the need for stronger and corporate accountability. This aligns with Mehmood et al.&apos;s
                argument that there must be an evolution of the privacy-preserving mechanisms with the expanding data
                collection practices. If this does not happen, then individuals, businesses, and society will remain
                vulnerable to cyberattacks, identity theft, and unethical data exploitation.
