            <h2>Decolonialism in Code and my development with JavaScript</h2>
            <h3>Decolonialism in Code</h3>
            <p>
                As developers, our work exists within a broader historical and cultural framework. Code is not
                inherently neutral—it carries implicit biases, assumptions, and power dynamics. This is because the
                developers that write the code each have their own ways of thinking, culture, influence and frame of
                reference. When thinking about how our coding practices matter in the context of decolonialism,
                it&apos;s
                crucial to recognise the ways in which digital spaces can either reinforce existing inequalities or
                foster inclusivity and accessibility.
            </p>
            <h3>Code and Decolonialism</h3>
            <p>
                One aspect of decolonial coding practice is being aware of the accessibility and representation of
                users. Are we assuming English as the default language? If so, why English and what implications would
                this have on developers that did not grow up learning English as their home language? Are we designing
                interfaces that only work smoothly for users with high-speed internet connections, what about areas that
                have a lower internet connection or device incompatibility? Are we considering diverse audiences in our
                UI/UX decisions? A decolonial approach to coding involves actively questioning these assumptions and, as
                developers providing the platforms, ensuring that technology is not maintaining exclusionary practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some things I would consider in my own development process include:
            <ul>
                <li>Language and Localization: Implementing multilingual support so that users from different
                    linguistic backgrounds can access content in their preferred language. It is important to not only
                    provide the content in the language that I speak but also provide capabilities of the content to be
                    shown in languages that other people may prefer to interact with.</li>
                <li>Inclusive Design: Avoiding Western-centric aesthetics and assumptions when designing layouts and
                    ensuring a more universally intuitive experience. Many forms of media are representative of Western
                    assumptions or aesthetics which can lead to an exclusive experience to people that are not in the
                    Western environment.</li>
                <li>Ethical Data Practices: Ensuring that any data collected respects the autonomy of users and does
                    not reinforce patterns of digital colonialism where users' information is exploited. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Incorporating JavaScript into My Website</h3>
            <p>
                I made several changes to my website to better integrate JavaScript functionalities. One of the biggest
                shifts has been implementing dynamic features that improve user interactivity, such as interactive
                points and smoother transitions. JavaScript allows real-time responsiveness which makes the experience
                feel more engaging rather than rigid and static where only HTML and CSS are used. This is shown mainly
                in the navigation bar of my website. Instead of hard coding the selection of the menu button with CSS
                and HTML, this can be done with JavaScript to provide a more dynamic interface for users.
            </p>
            <h3>Streamlining Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
                With JavaScript, interaction design has become more fluid, reducing friction in user experiences.
                Instead of requiring multiple pages reloads or relying on heavy server-side requests, JavaScript enables
                instant feedback for users. This not only improves efficiency but also fosters a more intuitive and
                user-friendly website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, coding is more than just writing logic—it&apos;s about understanding the impact our digital
                creations have on people. As I continue refining my development process, I'm committed to building
                digital spaces that are inclusive, thoughtful, and aligned with principles of equity to provide
                opportunities and outcomes by addressing systemic disparities.
