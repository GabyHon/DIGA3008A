        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <section class="week 1">
            <h3>"You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media" and how it speaks to the internet today
            </h3>
            <p>Moulthrop mentions that hypertext aids in the enrichment and rate of consumption of information [1].
                Information in the post-modern world is often catered to each individual user.
                The user can follow hypertext in their own interest and at their own pace. This enables users to have a
                specifically catered experience to themselves when accessing information while having the
                ability to consume information at a faster rate when compared to text that might have been published in
                a newspaper, book or other form of print. </p>
            <p> The growing use of hypertext has led to the creation and collaboration of information regardless of
                hierarchical norms. This can be seen in blog posts or online forums where any individual that
                has access to the interest today has the ability to create and collaborate with other individuals on
                information. The collaboration brings about the sharing of knowledge without needing an individual
                to acquire expertise in a certain topic to gain access to that information or participate in sharing
                that information. However, with the ever-growing number of individuals collaborating on information,
                there does need to be a structure in place to discern information that may look credible and information
                that may be actually correct.</p>
            <p> The internet today does however require an individual to determine what may be incorrect information,
                information that another individual may want to spread, and information that has been researched
                and confirmed. Hypertext has made it easier on social media platforms to share information, connect
                other individuals to topics, and connect different topics together. However, with the help of
                hypertext and hypermedia on social media platforms, information can easily be changed or misinterpreted.
                Individuals need to take precautions and develop skills to scrutinize information and the
                validity that a piece information may or may not hold.</p>

            <h3>Website reference material</h3>
            <p> <a href="https://www.outreach.space/" target="_blank">Outreach. A Mystery from Beyond:</a><br />
                Many of the websites that I want to take inspiration from are ones that make use of transitions. I want
                the transitions to be engaging to a user while not being too distracting.
                I want to make the transitions make a user feel like they can understand more about who I am and why I
                designed my website in a certain way.
                This space website is quite interesting in the sense of interacting with what looks like a 3D model
                while also giving information in a timeline format. The transitions used on this website are
                done in such a way that it makes the user think about space and orbital movements.
            </p>
            <a href="https://curenails.co/" target="_blank">Cure - Cure | Unique Nail and Wax Boutique in El Paso,
                TX:</a><br />
            This nail and wax boutique website contain minimal and affective transitions. The images or simply the
            appearance of one or two words convey what the website is about. I enjoyed the
            interactive horizontal scrolling to look at the products.
            </p>

            <a href="https://motion.zajno.com/" target="_blank">Motion Graphic Design & Animation Principles Website -
                Zajno Digital Studio:</a><br />
            On the motion graphic design website, I enjoy the position of words and how they appear as the user scrolls
            down which causes the focus on what appears.
