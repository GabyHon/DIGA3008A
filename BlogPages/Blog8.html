            <h2>Reflective reading on <cite>Digital inequalities and why they matter</cite></h2>
            <p>
                In the article Digital inequalities and why they matter, Robinson et al. [1] argue that the digital
                disparities are clear in both an individual-level and a bigger level such as socioeconomic status, race,
                gender, health care, politics, economic activity, and social capital. These digital inequalities can be
                seen in everyday life where many groups of people are not able to access, purposefully use, and gain
                benefits from using the internet which are seen as the different levels of digital inequalities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The authors argue that digital inequality impacts education, job opportunities, and political
                engagement. I agree that these areas can be impacted by digital inequalities. The impact on education
                was seen very clearly during the COVID-19 pandemic when there was the halting of contact teaching across
                South Africa. Students were required to continue their education through online teaching. However, many
                students did not have the digital technologies, adequate connection, or even power to actively
                participate and receive their educational content during the heavily restricted months. This showed that
                the digital inequality allowed people with access to an adequate device, connection, and power to engage
                seamlessly with online teaching and people typically in a lower socioeconomic status struggled to
                participate in online teaching.
            </p>
            <p>
                Political engagement is important as it allows people living in a country to stay up to date with
                relevant events in politics. I find that having access to a more powerful device, whether the device is
                newer mobile device or a computer, allows me to stay informed with the current political situation. This
                means that people that only have access to mobile devices or can&apos;t afford a newer model may not
                easily
                know what is happening in the country surrounding the politics due to slower connection speeds, or
                poorly optimized sites. Some political figures use social media as a way to inform citizens of the
                current affairs however due to digital inequalities, some of the information may not be easily accessed
                and used. This is shown on mobile devices that don&apos;t have the capabilities to run social media
                applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                I agree that digital inequality impacts job opportunities. There is a bigger move for companies to use
                digital platforms where individuals can apply and receive communication about potential opportunities.
                This means that it would be easier for someone that has a faster connection and who knows how to use the
                information released by a company to effectively apply to job opportunities. Individuals might have
                access to a digital device but might not have the knowledge and/or experience to effectively use their
                device to apply and receive communication from a company. This shows that digital inequalities have an
                impact on job opportunities. Individuals might physically go to companies, hear from someone they know,
                or view an information card/brochure/speech. This would allow an individual to learn about job
                opportunities however it would be a lot slower than someone that uses and knows how to effectively use a
                digital device to access job opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The digital inequalities that were mentioned reinforce the existing societal gaps that are seen on a
                day-to-day basis. I feel that to address these digital inequalities there needs to be a systemic effort
                to bridge the gaps in the access to digital infrastructure, education and opportunities. This will
                create a more inclusive society that is more connected and able to participate in the digital world for
                all individuals regardless of socioeconomic status.
