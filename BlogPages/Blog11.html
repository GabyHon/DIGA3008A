            <h2>Justice and Ethics in artistic and programming practice</h2>
            <p>
                The way I would approach justice and ethics in my artistic and programming practice would be to firstly
                design with the intention to ensure that there is equal access to the creative and digital experiences
                of my artefacts. Costanza-Chock [1] argues that inclusivity must be built into design processes from the
                start and that the needs of historically marginalized groups should be the focus rather than
                retrofitting accessibility for a later time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that another important aspect of justice and ethics in artistic and programming practice is for
                the developers and artists to remain accountable for any consequences that may come up from their
                produced work. This will ensure that any design choices made will avoid inadvertently contributing to
                systemic injustice as emphasized by Syal and Kramer [2]. This then talks to collaboration, whether there
                is online collaboration through open-source software or transparently sharing methodologies to identify
                any biases within artefacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collaboration does not only have to occur in spaces such as online spaces but actually designing and
                creating with communities. This will help developers and artists or designers to design and create not
                only for a community but to understand what the community would benefit from. Dombrowski et al. [3]
                outline strategies for participatory design that emphasises reciprocity and enablement. This ensures
                that the affected groups would have direct influence over the technical and creative results. The
                resulting solution to issues or future issues while working alongside communities would reflect lived
                experiences from the community instead of assumptions that possibly could be made about the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Art and technology should look at the long-term impacts such as sustainability and ethical
                responsibility over commercial success that may only last for a short-term. Looking at the social
                impact, ethical innovation, and longevity of artists and developers&apos; artefacts would ensure that
                the
                creative and digital work would contribute in a meaningful way to the future.
