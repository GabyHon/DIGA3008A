            <h2>Close reading on <cite>The Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results</h2>
            <p>
                The Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results paper by Ballatore et al. [1]
                investigated search engines and an assumption that the search engines provide neutral access to
                information. However, it was found that there was a correlation between locally produced content by
                wealthier countries and Google searches. This revealed a digital hierarchy where countries such as the
                United States (US) and Western European regions produce large amounts of information which are often the
                most visible and most pushed information. There were findings that showed regardless of the large number
                of people in cites there was relatively low amounts of content about that city in Google search results.
                Information inequalities are shown very prevalently with this result and can change how certain
                countries or cities are perceived globally by other countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article begins with looking at Google search results where Google still stands as the most widely
                used search engine across the world as seen on Global Stats [2]. The aims of the paper investigated
                firstly; the geographic origin of digital content that appears in the search results is examined.
                Secondly, the paper aimed to determine the extent to which the local content appeared in searches for
                the chosen cities. Thirdly, which countries produce their own digital representations, and which
                countries are defined by external sources. Lastly, investigating the factors which shape the digital
                geography which include the economic strength, publishing industries, and scientific output.
            </p>
            <p>
                The paper looked at the Google search results for 188 capital cities which included the many different
                versions of the search engine such as google.co.uk and google.co.za. The paper investigated the search
                results in different languages for each respective country. To determine the geographic origin of
                webpages, Sen et al.&apos;s [3] geoprovenance inference algorithm was used which predicted the country
                that
                published a specific URL. Another methodology that was used was measuring the ratio of locally produced
                search results versus external search results. The last methodology implemented was comparing the search
                results from Google in the US to the local search results to view the differences between the local and
                US search results.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results of the paper provide a critical lens on digital inequalities at the time. This showed how
                search engines marginalize local digital content and produce a larger spotlight onto dominant
                information and digital content producers such as the US. The findings of the paper show that there is a
                need for larger areas of inclusivity in digital spaces which would ensure that regions, regardless of
                the number of people living in the country, have the ability to digitally represent themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                This paper briefly explains that according to the model that was used to collect data and discuss showed
                that economic development and network connectivity are not enough to make content about that country
                more local in a Google search. This brings an unanswered question about how search results and the
                biases could affect tourism and business opportunities in countries and regions that are
                underrepresented by the search results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Future research can be done which promotes local content in terms of visibility and this can be where
                other disciplines contribute. In the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) which can be used as
                further research in how people in different countries access digital content. This would also bring in
                other questions and research around topics that the trained algorithm does not respond to without bias
                or avoidance.
