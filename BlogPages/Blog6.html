            <h2>Internet, Society, and Design Justice</h2>
            <p>
                The first article that I will look into is the “Digital Divide Widens” by Maria Tataki and Dimitris
                Glynos which speaks about the move that happened to online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic [1].
                One of the major issues that was prevalent during 2020 was the educational disruption and the lack of
                facilities and access to the internet which was needed by students to continue with their educational
                needs during lockdown. A shocking statistic of 82% of students in Sub-Saharan Africa were unable to go
                online during this period.
            </p>
            <p>
                A more recent article was released by Statistics South Africa which looked into the percentage gaps of
                people living in rural areas versus people living in urban areas that had access to resources to receive
                remote learning [2]. This article confirmed the divide between individuals living in rural areas versus
                urban areas and the need for the digital transition to take place in areas where individuals were
                affected the most. As mentioned by Tataki and Glynos, the increasing gap and inequality seen will
                continue to widen unless plans are created and implemented to provide high-quality and accessible access
                to the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some initiatives being taken such as the “One Laptop Per Child” which aims to teach children
                digital skills as well as provide lost-cost laptops for the children to use [3]. This is a good start in
                tackling the digital divide however, in countries such as South Africa, building the infrastructure
                needed would be the first step that should be taken. An article from 2024 indicates that there is still
                a divide seen in rural and underserved areas with internet connection through fibre [4]. There are some
                geographical barriers and installations of fibre does become costly however, there is still an
                encouragement to the private sector to become involved in creating a country where there is access to
                high-speed connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second article that I will be looking into is the ethical dilemmas in software engineering by Vincy
                Davis which speaks about the ethics and principles that are expected to be followed by software
                engineers [5]. There is a debate that software engineers have to participate in when building and
                creating products. The software space is often changing so software engineers have to constantly adapt
                old ethical principles, current ethical principles, and their own ethical standpoints to make ethical
                decisions. This however needs to have societal considerations that need to be taken into account. The
                product should adhere to a society where the software product is sustainable as well as catering to a
                range of different people with different experiences and communities. How the product is received, and
                future use of the software product needs to be considered.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some examples of ethical dilemmas in software engineering such as the Tesla car which made use of an
                assisted feature to the car however the choice to market the car as a fully autopilot car created a
                situation where an ethical dilemma was involved by not clearly stating that the product was just an
                enhancement and not a replacement for a driver [6].
