            <h2>A step into <cite>'As We May Think' at 65</cite> and my goals for this course</h2>
            <p>This week I came across a reading which spoke about the published work <cite>As We May Think</cite> by
                Vannevar
                Bush. Simon Harper mentions that the condition with which the human brain operates well in is where
                there is an association between information [1]. This speaks directly to the idea proposed by Bush where
                people can link information across different articles and therefore lead other readers in following the
                thought process and linking of another person [2]. I found this to be an interesting topic because many
                of my experiences while researching topics on the internet consist of moving from one article to many
                other articles. I often look at related topics or words associated with what I am researching. This
                helps my thought and memory process as I can remember key words or articles that are related to the
                topic. I can draw up a picture in my thought process which becomes like a tree with linking branches.
                The tree represents the broad topic and the branches represent all the information and associated ideas
                to the broad topic.</p>
            <p> The ever-growing amount of information that we as humans are producing can make it harder to remember
                and link to previous knowledge. I find that websites such as Wikipedia make use of this idea well where
                there are hyperlinks on words mentioned in articles published. A reader can hover over each word to read
                a brief description on the word or go to the page with more information relating to the word. I find
                this to be personally satisfactory as I can easily and quickly pause the reading on a topic to learn
                more about a related topic. This in turn can deepen my understanding on the original topic of interest.
            </p>
            <p> Hyperlinks are just one way that an article or topic can link different bits of information together.
                The use of audio, video, or animation can help enhance links between associated information. This falls
                under hypermedia which Denise Tolhurst describes as the linking of multiple formats such as text, video,
                audio, and still or animated graphics [3]. The use of text but also including other forms of media such
                as images or audio to link information together. In hypermedia an interesting topic of discussion is the
                use of adaptive hypermedia which Peter Brusilovsky explains to be a way of collecting data from users
                and creating personalized links and information for the user [4]. Although this can be useful for the
                user at the given moment, I feel that if that user would want to be given new information entirely
                disregarding previous data collected the adaptive hypermedia models would need to account for this. This
                is mentioned as being user modelling however was not the focus of the paper. I would like to research
                and look more into user modelling in the adaptive media space.</p>
            <p> The goals that I have for this course are to learn more about hypermedia and the uses it can have to
                individuals in engagement with information. The use of colour, text style and images and how this can
                influence different users to explore a website. I want to learn more about the development and history
                surrounding the progress of information sources on the web. The main goal that I have for this course
                would be to learn and create an exciting website that would contain my portfolio of work that I have
                done.</p>
