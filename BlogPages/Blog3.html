            <h2>User alignment and experience for my site</h2>
            <p>
                I have decided to focus my user alignment on learning about what I have produced and what I have an
                interest in. This will be done by creating a distinct path to the work I have produced such as placing
                games and artwork directly after the homepage opening title and/or image or first in a list of all the
                different pages on the homepage. I want to keep the homepage minimalistic in order not to overwhelm the
                users with too many images or too much information about me and the work I have completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content on my site will be in reverse chronological order to show the most recent work I have done,
                and the oldest work shown later. In my portfolio want the user to experience and view my current
                abilities and then if they are interested in my previous work they can navigate to my past work. The
                work that I will display will give a brief description and an image that the user can click on to go to
                another page to ensure that the main page of my work does not become too cluttered or too long to scroll
                through. The reverse-order will also be implemented for my blog posts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of my site's interface elements, I want the site to include some eye-catching transitions but
                transitions that can make an impact without causing stuttering of the website due to minimized internet
                connection or too many transitions on the page which could cause a user to leave my website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to keep a consistent semantic markup of each page on my site such as using the header one at the
                start of each page. When a user moves from page to page on my site, I will use relative referencing
                which will relate to the navigation semantic markup. This will make it easier for users to move through
                my site easily. This will then be my URL scheme which uses my folder structure to organize the various
                pages for my blog posts, profile, and design section.

            <h2>My development progress for the week</h2>
            <p>
                The progress that I made for this week includes successfully linking pages together that are situated in
                different folders, creating unordered lists, and working with hyperlinks on my pages. The blog posts
                that I added onto their own pages include references with hyperlinks. I incorporated the href attribute
                in the anchor element to include the hyperlink to the reference page and added the target attribute to
                allow the user to open the hyperlink in another tab and still allowing the user to stay on my site page.
            </p>
            <p>
                I create unordered lists to wrap the links to my pages. It was interesting to find out that I can create
                more unordered lists in a bigger unordered list. This can be used to show a menu list on my site within
                a bigger list.
            </p>
            <p>
                I embedded an image onto my homepage. However, I used the width attribute to rescale the enlarged image,
                and I am unsure whether this needs to rather be done with CSS at a later stage or if I need to import
                the image in a compressed format and then rescale with CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next week of my development progress, I want to look into jump links and decided whether I would
                want to incorporate them onto my site.
