            <h2>IxD process and reflection on my original wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                Working through the IxD process I noticed that I had not quite set my core goal for my website. However,
                based on my first wireframes I want users to navigate through every page and see everything that I
                display on my website such as exploring on a map. This can be done with a progress bar or check points.
                I was thinking about creating a visual outline of the progress once all the pages are visited or adding
                colour to the whole progress bar. This could become distracting for a user so I will have to test this
                by asking some of my peers to view the two options to gauge their thoughts and reactions to the two
                ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have defined my user to be someone that is interested in learning more about me, such as a job
                recruiter, as well as my lecturers since this project is part of my course work. I will need to not only
                include the necessary points and sections to be marked but also include aspects that I could possibly
                use as a selling point to a potential recruiter.
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of my content, I believe that the most important and most interesting items that I want to
                showcase are the most recent works that I have completed. My content will include previous works to
                allow my user to view the development of my work. I want to include a sort of summary of the information
                and then have separate pages to ensure that my user focuses on the selected piece of information rather
                than multiple parts at one time.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the user flow I want the user to have the ability to view my work from most recent to earliest or if
                the user decides to view my work from earliest to most recent. This can be done with JavaScript and/or
                CSS to allow the user to scroll up or down. I want the typical scrolling down to loop through my work
                from most recent to earliest, however scrolling up would navigate to previous or earlier work.
            </p>

            <p>
                My original wireframes are designed around an exploration theme, so I want the interface elements of my
                website to include mostly navigational and informational components but also a few input controls. I
                want to combine an input control such as a checkbox and an informational component such as a progress
                bar. My user would be able to advance the progress bar as well as check the checkboxes once they have
                viewed the subsections of my sections. However, another way that this could be done is with a
                navigational component such as pagination. Again, I will have to test these ideas out on various
                potential users such as my classmates, friends, or family.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am still in working through the IxD process, so the end of this process surrounds the design and
                implementation. I need to collect more reference material to start thinking about and deciding on what
                parts of the reference material I like that may help with my design. I am not decided yet on the feel
                and look that I want to evoke to my users and how it would relate to my content.

            <h2>Reflection on my work for website 1</h2>
            <p>
                In the beginning I struggled a bit with understanding the navigation between my files in different
                folders. But after a bit of research, I managed to successfully navigate from some file to another. I am
                proud of my folder structure and using multiple pages for each section and the subsections. For example,
                the weekly blog posts are on different pages to the page that holds the main title of blog posts. I find
                that this helps to keep each main page less cluttered. Moving forward I might want to change my list
                structure to achieve the subsections for each section of my website.
