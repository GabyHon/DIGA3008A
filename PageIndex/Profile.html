            I am currently a third year student studying BEngSc in Digital Arts. I dabble in coding, electronics, and
            game design for my schoolwork.
            Outside of studying I mostly play digital games with the occassional firing up during analog games.
            I do however enjoy my fair share of outdoors activities such as running, team sports such as hockey
            (although sad to say I haven't played in about five years now), recently I've been trying out calisthenics, and the well known
            time to "touch some grass" (which consists of taking a walk amongst nature).
