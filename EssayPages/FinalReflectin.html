            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Through my journey of learning more about web development and interactive media I have discovered how
                certain decisions made by a developer can impact positively or negatively on users. I have learnt the
                fundamentals needed to produce and implement improvements to websites and webpages that I develop.
            </p>

            <h2>Geopolitical Conflicts in AI Governance</h2>
            <p>
                The Élysée AI Action Summit report [1] highlights the mirrored geopolitical conflicts shown during AI
                governance debates. The report shows that some nations advocated for open AI ecosystems and other
                nations prioritising technological nationalism. The U.S. and European nations advocated for AI
                regulation to focus on security while nations such as China spoke about AI as a tool for economic
                independence. This shows the digital hegemonies where the space of AI becomes the topic of debate for
                the influences over global digital infrastructure.
            </p>

            <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
            <p>
                The folder structure that I chose to implement reflects the hierarchical information structure of my
                content such that subsequent files and folders are under their own sections. This ensures that content
                that is specific to webpages is kept together, and no clutter or confusion happens with other webpage
                content. I have used folders in folders to make sure that my folder structure is modular and scalable if
                there is an increase in the content needed on a webpage. The naming convention that I used is Pascal
                case. This naming convention is modular and scalable to make it easy to navigate to files and use for
                referencing. There is a separation between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where CSS and JavaScript files that
                are used across multiple pages are under their own folders to create easy access and implementation.
            </p>

            <h2>Semantic Markup</h2>
            <p>
                I tried to limit the number of divisions
            <div> that I used to ensure that someone that wanted to look at the code I implemented, or screen readers
                would understand what each container, section, division and so forth would result in on the webpage.
                Although the divisions that I did use were implemented for better control alongside JavaScript to
                control containers such as my navigation and previews of the webpages. It was easier to control the
                positioning of the divisions for my navigation circles on my index webpages compared to the button tag.
                However, I would want to try again in the future to change the div circles into buttons as this would
                make it clearer to screen readers or other developers what the purpose of the circles is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Articles and sections were used in webpages that contained large quantities of text such as my blog
                    and essay sections along with the appropriate headings to ensure a logical order to my content. The
                    &lt;alt&gt; tag was used for images and the tag &lt;main&gt; was used to ensure accessibility and
                    tell users the
                    logical format of the content on each page.
                </p>

                <h2>Metadata</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that I have provided a lot of information in my metadata particularly in the head section
                    of each HTML document. I use the description and keywords to help search engines display relevant
                    information parts to users that may come across my website. I also include the author metadata to
                    show that the developer of the website and subsequent webpages is me. The standard HTML template
                    ensures that I make use of the viewport and character encoding in all my HTML files. All the
                    metadata that I used helps improve the usability, accessibility, and search visibility of my
                    website.
                </p>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    I keep my code maintainable by excluding any in-line styling in my files and preventing
                    unpredictable overriding of global stylings. The global styling is embedded with the link tag in the
                    head section of the HTML files. I use flexbox to allow for flexible layouts and responsive design
                    across different devices. With these I use media queries to adjust my styling for the different
                    device screen sizes. The use of rem and % for relative units to ensure that there is better
                    scalability of my content such as the text and size of images and icons.
                </p>

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    I make use of event listeners and DOM manipulation rather than hard coded capabilities. This is
                    shown clearly through the navigation of my pages. Aspects such as closing and opening my navigation
                    bar as well as viewing and looping through the previews of my sub-pages like my blogs, designs, and
                    essays. This ensures that there is a more dynamic process to my website and reusable logic and
                    events can be placed into functions to be easily used multiple times to reduce redundancy within my
                    code. The use of asynchronous functions also helps my webpages from having to reload every time the
                    user navigates to new pages.
                </p>

                <h2>Going forward</h2>
                <p>
                    There are definitely aspects of my website that I would want to improve on such as a more cohesive
                    feel to the layout of my website almost as the feeling of a journey. This could be through creating
                    a pseudo movement of the background to make it appear that the user to orbiting a celestial body.
                    The final implementation of my website is a good foundation with various unconventional interaction
                    points such as the navigation circle as well as conventional interactions such as the navigation bar
                    with the drop-down menu.
